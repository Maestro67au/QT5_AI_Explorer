# QT5_AI_Explorer
I made a QT5 application to explore the variious openai models, it updates the models in real time so even the latest versions of GPT are available.

I used pycharm to fine tune and debug my program. And credit needs to go to the ChatGPT service for much of the base code and fault finding.
To use this tool you need to sign into openai api program and retreive an api key. Then put your api key into the environment variable.
This is the easiest way to guarentee that the key stays local to your machine and is not accidentally exported with the main program.

I have taken all reasonable care in making this tool, but the responsibility is up to you how you choose to use it.
